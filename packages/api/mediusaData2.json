The straps can also be used to cover any potential gaps that may appear in between the straps where the circaid reduction kit has difficulty matching the limb contour. The application generally occurs when there are large jumps in the circumference measurements and the limb may need additional support and compression. The reduction kit shelf straps come with additional hook and loop tabs allowing you to create as many as 3 straps from this item.",
